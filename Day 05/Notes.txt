Pipeline:
---------
ls -l /usr/bin | less
ls | wc -l

Pipelines, Redirection, and Appending to a File:
-------------------------------------------------
ls > /tmp/saved-output | less
ls -t | head -n 10 | tee /tmp/ten-last-changed-files
ls -l | tee -a /tmp/append-files

find command:
-------------
find <search location> <criteria> <value for criteria> 

find /root -name test
find /root -type f  --> for file search
find /root -type d --> for folder search
find /root -type l --> for links search

File Permission:
-----------------
A file in Linux has 3 permissions: read, write and execute. Each of them has an absolute value to them. 

Read(r) has 4, write(w) has 2 and execute(x) has 1. 
For a given file, there will be an owner, group owner and other users. 
Each of these users will have specific permission on the file. 
If all these users have full permission on the file, it means the permission of the file is 777(7 for owner, 7 for group owner, 7 for other users). 
7 is the sum of total of the absolute values of all three permissions (read, write and execute).

To find a file based on the permission of the file, use the -perm option.

The value for -perm can be specified in 2 ways.

i) absolute way (777)
ii) symbolic way(u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx)

find / -type f -perm 755
find / -type d -perm u=rwx

chmod 777 <filename>
chmod u=rwx filename
