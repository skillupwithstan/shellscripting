OS  Desktop Version & Server Version

Open-Source Operating System:
*****************************
The open-source operating system permits the use of publicly accessible, freely distributable code for commercial purposes. An open-source OS’s source code is accessible since it is an open-source application or programmed. According to their needs, the user can alter or edit those programs and create new apps. 

Open-source operating systems include Linux, Open Solaris, Open BDS, Free BSD, Minix, etc.

Advantages:
----------
Reliable: The open-source operating systems are most reliable.

Cost-efficient: Most of the open-source operating systems are free and some of them are less expensive.

Flexibility: We can customize it as per our requirement.

Disadvantages:
-------------
Complicated: It is not as user-friendly as the ones that are closed. To use this software, we must have a basic understanding of technology.

Risk to Safety: Even if the flaws have been found, there is still a threat of attacks because the attackers have access to the source code.

Lack of support: There is no customer service accessible to help you if you encounter a problem.

Commercial operating system
***************************
The commercial operating system is not publicly accessible, not freely distributable code for commercial purposes. 

For commercial, the users need to spend moderate to expensive cost. It is available under high licensing cost. 

A commercial OS’s source code is not accessible since it is a commercial or closed-source application or programmed. 

According to their needs, the user can’t alter or edit those programs and create new apps.

Some of the best Commercial Operating Systems:

Windows OS
Mac OS
Unix
Oracle

Advantages:
----------
A single point of contact for any issues: Once paid for a piece of software, we have a real-world counterparty to deal with if a problem does occur.

Clearly defined licensing and usage conditions: Commercial software for organization has the advantage of coming with a well-documented promise that you will have support behind it.

A well-defined plan for the software and upgrade: Companies can avoid the costs associated with technological failures by performing timely upgrades.

Disadvantages:
--------------
Strict guidelines for licensing: In an effort to avoid software audits, more than a quarter of companies admit to over-licensing.

Exclusive source code: You won’t be able to modify the source code to for your requirements. You have to subscribe to a more costly plan to get any extra functionality.

Risk of losing a software license: There’s a good possibility that the app will be idle unless it’s software 
required for the operation of your business. Various studies suggest that between 30 and 37% of commercial software licenses owned by businesses are unused or highly overused.

Help system
------------

The help command is the simplest way to get information regarding a built-in shell command. It helps you fetch information from the shell’s internal documentation.

It takes a text string as the command line argument and looks for the provided string in the shell’s documents. 

This saves the time spent in going through the entire documentation.


help cd
help pwd
help help
