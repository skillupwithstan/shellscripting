Display the Command History
****************************
The history command displays a list of previously executed commands that are prefixed with a command number.

The exclamation point character (!) is a metacharacter to expand previous commands without retyping them. 

The !number command expands to the command that matches the specified number. 

The !string command expands to the most recent command that begins with the specified string.

Absolute Paths and Relative Paths
*********************************
An absolute path is a fully qualified name that specifies the exact location of the file in the file-system hierarchy. 
It begins at the root (/) directory and includes each subdirectory that must be traversed to reach the specific file. 

Every file in a file system has a unique absolute path name, which is recognized with a simple rule: a path name with a forward slash (/) as the first character is an absolute path name.

For example, the absolute path name for the system message log file is /var/log/messages.

A relative path identifies a unique location and specifies only the necessary path to reach the location from the working directory. Relative path names follow this rule: a path name with anything other than a forward slash as the first character is a relative path name. 

For example, relative to the /var directory, the message log file is log/messages.

Basic Commands:
***************

# Displays the full path name of the current working directory
pwd

# Lists directory contents for the specified directory or, if no directory is given, for the current working directory.
ls
ls –l      # long listing format
ls –a     # all files, including hidden files
ls –R     # recursive, to include the contents of all subdirectories


# To change your shell's current working directory. If you do not specify any arguments to the command, then it changes to your home directory.
cd  /etc

# To move up one level to the parent directory, without needing to know the exact parent name.
cd ..

# To create a file & updates the time stamp of a file to the current date and time.
touch /tmp/test.txt
